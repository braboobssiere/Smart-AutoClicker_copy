      description: |
        In order for the developpers to find the issue, must provide as much data as possible., and always attach screenshots/video of the bug. \
        If you think there is a bug in the scenario execution, you must always provide a minimal scenario to reproduce it, not your complete 100 events 1K conditions scenario. \
        If you think there is a bug with a scenario backup import, you must always provide the problematic scenario zip file. \
        Any ticket with not enough information will be automatically closed.
